About
-----

ETA/OS is a small scale, embedded kernel and/or operating system. It provides
basic hardware abstraction allowing an application programmer to build somewhat
portable embedded applications. Some of its features:

  * Memory management
  * Scheduler (semi-SMP ready)
  * Interrupt management
  * Timer management
  * Driver core
  * Bunch of basic drivers (USART etc..)

License

ETA/OS is licenced as GNU Lesser General Public Licence version 3 or newer. 
The COPYING file should contian more information about the licence, or

Compiling ETA/OS
----------------

To retrieve and build ETA/OS the following tools are required:

Retreiving:
  * Git
or
  * a tarball download

Build tools (for the host and target system):
  * GCC tool chain (binutils and gcc)
    - gcc
    - ld
    - as
    - objcopy
  * A working Linux distribution (windows isn't supported (yet))

To test:
  * simulavr
or
  * embedded hardware (arduino's etc..)

Before you can build ETA/OS you have to configure it. Run

    make menuconfig ARCH=archname

to start the configuration process.

When you are finished configuring the project run the following make commands
to fully build ETA/OS:

    make prepare ARCH=archname
    make all ARCH=archname
    make modules_install ARCH=archname INSTALL_MOD_PATH=path

After that, you are ready to compile an application. To compile an application
you need application sources and Kbuild file in a sepperate directory (anywhere).
See the usr/tests/ directory for some examples.

Contributing
------------

To see how you can help improving ETA/OS, read the contribution guide. You can
find it in the CONTRIBUTING.md file in the repository or on the
[web](http://etaos.bietje.net/contrib.html).

Trouble shooting
----------------

* Solving the avrdude timeout for the Arduino Mega / ATmega2560:

For some reason, avrdude is sometimes unable to properly communicate
with the ATmega2560. This solution can be tried when you receive the
following error:

	avrdude: stk500v2_ReceiveMessage(): timeout

If you run into this error, there are 3 'scripts' provided to work around
it:

```bash
user@pc$ scripts/avrdude_timeout_fix [DEVICE_FILE]
```

Now you can upload your binaries to the ATmega.

If you would like a tty-fix script and an upload in one, then you should give
either calypso (for unit tests) or `scripts/avr_upload` a try.

```bash
user@pc$ scripts/avr_upload -h
```

Please note that these are not 'run once and be good forever' scripts. They need
to be ran before _every_ upload.
